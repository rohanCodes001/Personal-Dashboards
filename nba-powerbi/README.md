# NBA Power BI Dashboard

This folder contains data, scripts, and documentation
for the NBA Power BI analytics project.

Basketball Dashboard.pbix contains the NBA Dashboard. 
1. To run it, simply download the pbix file and refresh the data by clicking the refresh button in the top left menu bar.
2. The datasets already come from a python script that is posted in the scripts folder that goes through the nba_api and obtains the fact and dimension tables for the teams and players.
3. The PBIX file simply connects to these datasets that are uploaded in the datasets folder via api connections to this public repository so no need to download any other files besides the .pbix file to use this dashboard.
